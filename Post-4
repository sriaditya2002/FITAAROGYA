<ul><li><strong>Reduce the overall calories you consume.</strong> If you consume more calories than you use through daily living, exercise, and other activities, it may lead to weight gain. If you consume fewer calories than you use through physical activity, it may lead to weight loss.</li><li><strong>Have healthy snacks on hand.</strong> Whether you are at home, at work, or on the go, healthy snacks may help combat hunger and prevent overeating. Look for snacks that are low in added sugar and salt. Your best bets are whole foods—like baby carrots, fresh fruit, or low-fat or fat-free yogurt instead of chips, cakes, or cookies—rather than packaged or processed foods.</li><li><strong>Select a mix of colorful vegetables each day.</strong> Choose dark, leafy greens—such as spinach, kale, collards, and mustard greens—and red and orange vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes, red peppers, and tomatoes. If you have had kidney stones, be aware that some vegetables, like spinach and sweet potatoes, are high in oxalate, a chemical that combines with calcium in urine to form a common type of kidney stone. So, if you have kidney stones, you may need to watch how much of this you eat. But for others, these are great choices. Eat a rainbow of food colors!</li><li><strong>Choose whole grains more often.</strong> Try whole-grain breads and pastas, oatmeal, or brown rice.</li><li><strong>Shift from solid fats to oils.</strong> Try cooking with vegetable, olive, canola, or peanut oil instead of solid fats such as butter, stick margarine, shortening, lard, or coconut oil. Choose foods that naturally contain oils, such as seafood and nuts, instead of some meat and poultry. And use salad dressings and spreads that are made with oils rather than solid fats.</li><li><strong>Switch from frying to baking or grilling. </strong>Instead of fried chicken, try a salad topped with grilled chicken. Instead of ordering fries when eating out, ask for a side of steamed veggies.</li><li><strong>Limit foods and beverages that are high in sugar and salt.</strong> Avoid snack foods high in salt and added sugars; and keep away from sugary soft drinks.</li><li><strong>Read the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods.</strong> The Nutrition Facts label tells you how many calories and servings are in a box, package, or can. The label also shows how many ingredients, such as fat, fiber, sodium, and sugar—including added sugars—are in one serving of food. You can use these facts to make healthy food choices.</li></ul>
