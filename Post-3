<p><strong>The world around you.</strong> Your home, community, and workplace all may affect how you make daily lifestyle choices. Food and beverages high in fat, added sugar, and calories are easy to find and sometimes hard to avoid. And they often cost less than healthier choices like fruits and vegetables. On top of that, smartphones and other devices may make it easy for you to be less active in your daily routine.</p>

<p><strong>Families.</strong> Overweight and obesity tend to run in families, suggesting that genes may play a role in weight gain. Families also share food preferences and habits that may affect how much, when, and what we eat and drink.</p>

<p><strong>Medicines.</strong> Some medicines, such as steroids <em>NIH external link</em>, and some drugs for depression <em>NIH external link</em> and other chronic health problems, may lead to weight gain. Ask your health care professional or pharmacist about whether weight gain is a possible side effect of medicines you are taking and if there are other medicines that can help your health without gaining weight.</p>

<p><strong>Emotions.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes people snack, eat, or drink more when they feel bored, sad, angry, happy, or stressed—even when they are not hungry. Consider whether it might be your emotions making you want to eat, and try doing something else to help you cope with negative feelings or celebrate your good mood. That can help you feel better and avoid weight gain.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of sleep.</strong> In general, people who get too little sleep tend to weigh more than those who get enough sleep.<sup>2</sup> There are several possible explanations. Sleep-deprived people may be too tired to exercise. They may take in more calories simply because they are awake longer and have more opportunities to eat. Lack of sleep may also disrupt the balance of hormones that control appetite. Researchers have noticed changes in the brains of people who are sleep deprived. These changes may spark a desire for tasty foods.<sup>3</sup> Learn more about sleep deprivation and deficiency <em>NIH external link</em> and strategies for getting enough sleep.</p>
